            <h3>What's this all about?</h3>
            <p>
               Raku is an expressive and flexible programming language with a relatively
               simple mechanism to bind to native libraries, it seems a good choice for implementing certain types of audio and
               music applications, and it's fun too!
            </p>
            <p>
               The aim of this group is to provide a focus for people writing sound
               oriented applications in Raku and to help people find or use the tools
               and libraries that are already available. If there is stuff out there
               we want to bring it to people's attention.

            <h3>So what can I do now?</h3>
            <p>
               There already exist modules for reading and writing audio files,
               encoding and decoding various formats, interfacing with other
               audio software, reading and writing MIDI and audio data from
               devices and other things beside, at some point we'll get round to
               curating a proper list but for the meantime you can browse the <a
               href="https://modules.perl6.org">modules list</a> to see what already
               exists.
            </p>
            <p>
               If something you really want doesn't already exist, let us know; it
               could be that someone already has it on their TODO list or they might
               be looking for something new to work on.
            </p>
            <p>
               We can also be found on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/raku-noise-gang">IRC</a>, come along and
               have a chat.

            <h3>How can I help?</h3>
            <p>
               There are no end of libraries that could be made or that the author needs
               help with, we may even have adopted some modules that may need some love.
               Just jump in and start making or mending stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
               We also want to make some guides, how-to documentation and the like, so if
               you like playing around with software, making noise at the same time and
               writing documentation at the same time then do it, the more the merrier.
            </p>
            <p>
               And of course if you make anything cool or interesting we'd love to know,
               if you have recorded something using Raku we'd love to hear it, and
               though we haven't really thought that far ahead right now, we'll work
               out some way of show-casing it :)
