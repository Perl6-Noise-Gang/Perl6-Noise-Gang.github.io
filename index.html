<p>This is a group for the promotion and support of audio and music application development in <a href="http://perl6.org/">Perl&nbsp;6</a></p>
			<h3>What's this all about?</h3>
			<p>
				Perl 6 is an expressive and flexible programming language with a relatively simple mechanism to bind to native libraries, it seems
            a good choice for implementing certain types of audio and music applications, and it's fun too!
			</p>
			<p>
				The aim of this group is to provide a focus for people writing sound oriented applications in Perl 6 and to help people find or
				use the tools and libraries that are already available. If there is stuff out there we want to bring it to people's attention.
			</p>
			<h3>So what can I do now?</h3>
			<p>
				There already exist modules for reading and writing audio files, encoding and decoding various formats, interfacing with other
				audio software, reading and writing MIDI and audio data from devices and other things beside, at some point we'll get round to
				curating a proper list but for the meantime you can browse the <a href="modules.perl6.org">modules list</a> to see what already
				exists.
			</p>
			<p>
				If something you really want doesn't already exist, let us know; it could be that someone already has it on their TODO list or
            they might be looking for something new to work on.
			</p>
			<h3>How can I help?</h3>
			<p>
				There are no end of libraries that could be made or that the author needs help with, we may even have adopted some modules that
				may need some love.  Just jump in and start making or mending stuff.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also want to make some guides, how-to documentation and the like, so if you like playing around with software, making noise at
				the same time and writing documentation at the same time then do it, the more the merrier.
			</p>
			<p>
				And of course if you make anything cool or interesting we'd love to know, if you have recorded something using Perl 6 we'd love
				to hear it, and though we haven't really thought that far ahead right now, we'll work out some way of show-casing it :)
